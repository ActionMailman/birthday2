	<h1>Wowza!</h1>
	<p> Happy eighteenth! So, I made a website for your birthday. I’m not exactly sure where this falls on the hierarchy of birthday presents, but I need something new for my GitHub, so this is what you’re getting. To gloss over your good qualities as a human being, and why the world should be excited by you becoming an adult: you're smart, you're curious towards what you don't know (which is what first made me want to be friends with you), you're kind, and you're supportive. Pretty much all the basics to making a good person. <br><br> This is the age that marks your passing into adulthood, or so I am told. This opens up a variety of new and exciting opportunities and challenges. For one, you’ll be in the city more often, and since you, Chris, and I are all going to be going to college in Manhattan, hitting the town will be more fun and enjoyably lucrative than ever. Since you won’t be as busy (hopefully), you’ll also be able to get cultured. Read for fun. See that tv show that everyone’s talking about. Watch some movies! Seriously, I don’t want to see you answering “Monster’s Inc” in response to what your favorite piece of media is anymore—that’s depressing. <br><br> Hell, you might even want to find yourself a significant other, although that’s a big maybe. I don’t know what you and your family’s stance on that is maybe you got an arranged marriage situation going on or maybe you’re asexual or something not that I think you are I’m just saying I don’t judge what was I talking about again? I feel like I’m not focusing on the thing I’m supposed to oh yeah it’s your birthday. <br><br> More importantly, I want you to know that all this fanfare about adulthood is completely arbitrary. You still have time to figure everything out and enjoy yourself along the way. We don’t suddenly become adults once the timer goes off and everyone realizes we’ve been around for 6570 days. We have to get used to the uncharted waters that we’re being placed in, and we’re going to flounder, making a <i>lot</i> of mistakes while trying to stay afloat—that’s okay, that’s part of growing up. <br> You’re probably one of the smartest people I know, and definitely smarter than me in some ways, so I don’t want to speak down to you as if I have access to some great wisdom that you don’t, but I wanted to say something meaningful to what we’re both going through. You’ll be fine. Happy birthday.  </p>
